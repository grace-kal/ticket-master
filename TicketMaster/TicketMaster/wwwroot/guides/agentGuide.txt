Navigation Bar.
When first logged in, if the user is in role "Agent", they will see multicolored nav bar item "Agent Mode". This item is seen only by users in role "Agent" and "Admin"!
When clicked on "Agent Mode" the link redirects the user to the Agent/Home/Index and the layout is switched to _AgentLayout rather than the default _Layout.
There will be a change in all nav bar items when redirected trough the link for changing mode.
