Navigation Bar.
When first logged in, if the user is in role "Admin", they will see multicolored nav bar items"Admin Mode" and "Agent Mode". These items are seen only by users in role "Admin"!
When clicked on "Admin Mode" the link redirects the user to the Admin/Home/Index and the layout is switched to _AdminLayout rather than the default _Layout.
If clicked on "Agent Mode" the link redirects the user to the Agent/Home/Index and the layout is switched to _AgentLayout rather than the default _Layout.
There will be a change in all nav bar items when redirected trough either of the links for changing mode.
